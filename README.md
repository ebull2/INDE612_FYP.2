Final Year Project



# **FYP Proposal**

For my final year project, I have decided to do a widget hub platform that collects all of the popular insights and news to what the user has selected. There will be a set number of categories that will contain the top different types of interests and then will display headlines, images and data all on one screen.

I have chosen to go with this idea as personally I really like the use of widgets as a new feature in the IOS updates, I think it helps me retrieve important information quickly such as stocks, top news headlines and weather. I would like to expand this approach and include loads of more different types of categories.
